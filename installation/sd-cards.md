# SD cards

Raspberry Pi computers use a micro SD card, except for very early models which use a full-sized SD card.

**Note:** Because of a hardware limitation in the Raspberry Pi Zero, 1 and 2, the boot partition on the SD card must be 256GB or smaller otherwise the device will not boot up. Later models of Raspberry Pi 2 with a BCM2837 SoC, Raspberry Pi 3, 4 and 400 do not have this limitation. This does not affect Raspberry Pi OS, which always uses a small boot partition.
