# SD cards

Raspberry Pi computers use a micro SD card, except for very early models which use a full-sized SD card.

## Limitation on Raspberry Pi Zero, 1 and 2 computers

There is a hardware limitation on Pi Zero, 1 and 2 computers which prevents booting if the SD card contains a partition that is larger than 256GB. In practice this means that you must use an SD card that is 256GB or smaller, although it is possible to work around this limitation.
